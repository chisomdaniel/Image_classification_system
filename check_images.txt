Answer: Yes they all classified the breed of dog in Dog_01 to be the same


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? 
If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Only one of the model (ResNet) was able to classify the two dog images to be of the same breed


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: they all missed the Animal_name_o1.jpg image and classified it to be a kite, but it was actually a specie of bird


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. 
Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Well for this particular task, I will chose ResNet to be the best because it is the only architecture to correctly identify the two dog images 
along with the object image.
